STM32H5x Makefile Standalone Refactor Log
========================================
Date: 2025-10-25

Summary:
--------
The makefile was refactored to remove all STM32CubeIDE dependencies and use standard GNU Make logic. This enables building the project from the command line without any IDE-generated files.

Key Changes:
------------
1. Removed all `-include` statements for auto-generated files (sources.mk, subdir.mk, objects.mk, etc.).
2. Automatically detect all C sources in `Src/` and assembly sources in `Startup/` using `wildcard`.
3. All object files are now built into the `build/` directory.
4. Added pattern rules for compiling C and assembly files to objects in `build/`.
5. Linking, listing, and size calculation are handled with explicit rules using `arm-none-eabi-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-objdump`.
6. The linker script is referenced from the `linker/` directory.
7. Added a `clean` rule to remove all build artifacts.
8. The makefile is now portable and does not require STM32CubeIDE or its auto-generated files.

Usage:
------
- `make all`   : Build the project
- `make clean` : Remove all build artifacts
- `make size`  : Show the size of the ELF output

This log documents the transition to a fully standalone, portable makefile for STM32H5x projects.
